                <p class='item-p'>This is an 18x24 inch oil pastel pepper drawn on white poster paper. I made this 
                  during a high school art class. Oil pastel can be very tricky to work with, especially 
                  trying avoid splotching while covering a large surface as I did in this piece. I am
                  especially proud of how the highlights make the pepper appear shiny; the stem also adds 
                  more of an element of realism with the attention to detail exhibited in the highlights and shadows.

                <p class ='item-p'>This are the many pop art-inspired cows I have painted. The medium is acrylic
                  paint on white canvas. These are popular 
                  among my friends and family; I have had many requests for cow paintings! At this point, I can paint 
                  one of these with my eyes closed. I have plans to create prints of all the paintings I have done to
                  potentially sell them on an Etsy page.

              <p class ='item-p'>This piece is also from a high school art class and is one that I pride myself on. 
                The medium is graphite pencil on white paper; I'd consider the style of this drawing to be 
                realism, a style which I am not particularly well-versed in. I am very happy with how this piece turned
                out.

                <p class ='item-p'> I was commissioned to paint this Khalid "American Teen" album cover by a friend
                  during Summer 2020. The medium is acrylic paint on white canvas. I love how clean the lines of the 
                  man and background mountains are; they are both outlined in thin, black sharpie.
