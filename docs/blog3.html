            The account I will be auditing is the <a href='https://twitter.com/FBI'>Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Twitter account</a>. The first thing I notice is that each tweet follows the same structure: a link to an external article, website, or photograph with a brief caption describing the contents of link or photograph. An “@” is often featured in the caption to send readers to the Twitter account more locally involved in the news of the respective tweet. For instance, a tweet regarding the felony arrest of a Missouri man involved in the January 6 Capitol Breach links to the official FBI press release about this event as well as FBI Washington Field Twitter account, which likely has more localized information regarding the tweet. This straightforward structure plays well toward the purpose of the FBI. Each tweet reads like a press conference or title to a news article. News is conveyed in the simplest manner possible with the embedded links to the related external source serving to provide more information if the reader desires.

            The accounts’ bio is similarly straightforward. First, it names itself as the “Official FBI Twitter.” It then provides a link to the online form where users can submit a tip to the FBI for investigation. Finally, the bio gives a link to the U.S. Department of Justice Privacy Policy, which outlines what information the DOJ takes in and what is done with that information once it is gathered. In line with the general structure of the FBI Twitter account, the straightforward structure and tone of the bio presents the appropriate information to users while steering clear of confusing messages or superfluous content. Its presentation is very utilitarian in nature: only the minimum, most significant information is given in each tweet.

            Twitter is an appropriate platform for the FBI to use because of the wide audience it reaches. To my knowledge, people of a wide age range use Twitter. This allows the FBI to project current news to its 3.5 million followers. Further, since Twitter is such a large platform, it may allow news to reach users who would not typically tune into other media, such as television or radio.

            In government, I find it most beneficial when an organization, bureau, actor, etc. gives the most straightforward information possible. Far too much of the message and truth of a news release becomes lost when it is presented with extra information, specifically extra comments that overly politicize a manner. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s utilitarian approach to social media use accompanied with ample links to outside sources with more information is an ideal model for a government body looking to gain a presence on any social media platform.
