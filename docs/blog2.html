            My presence on social media is fairly limited. Despite this, I feel as though the one of Freberg's Social Media "sins" I would be most likely to be tempted to commit is uniformity.  As Freberg describes it, uniformity means sharing the “same content on every platform” (33). The social media apps I most frequently use include Instagram, Snapchat, and Tik Tok. In the past, I have posted a picture, often of a landscape or view I particularly enjoy, on my Snapchat story, Instagram story, and sometimes even my Instagram feed. It is easy to fall in love with a certain photograph, thus fueling the desire to share it across as many platforms as possible. If I love a picture of a certain building or have captured a landscape or skyline when the lighting is just right, I am tempted to share it in as many places as possible. On the same topic of being tempted to share pictures I really like, I would also be tempted to come across as narcissistic on social media. Historically, I have no enjoyed having my photo taken and often struggle to capture one that I truly like. This all changes when I am feeling confident and have had a photo taken that I particularly enjoy. One glance at my Instagram feed may paint me in the light of narcissism since nearly all my photographs exclusively feature me and few are group shots. The reality of this is that I dislike taking photos with other people because of personal body image insecurities, particularly when it comes to my height. I am quite a bit taller than my friends and this quality is obviously far less noticeable when I am standing alone. I'm not sure if this qualifies as narcissism because it stems from insecurity, but the reality is that it may come across as it regardless.

        <p style='text-indent: 25px;' class='blog-post'>Twitter's terms of service contract completely contradicts itself within a matter of three sentences. The first paragraph under the "Your Rights and Grant of Rights in the Content" section explicitly states that "What's yours is yours," emphasizing that the content a user posts belongs to the user. However, the very next paragraph discusses that any media a user posts to the platform is free for Twitter to have the right to "worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods now known or later developed (for clarity, these rights include, for example, curating, transforming, and translating)" (Twitter Terms of Service, section 3). Twitter uses the excuse that they want to share your content with more users globally, but this section feels more like an attempt to have ownership over anything that is posted online. I understand my "right to ownership" on Twitter as being especially minimal. Having a private account often stops a users tweets from being shared with non-followers, but I could not find anything in the terms of service or privacy policy that stated that private accounts are not subject to the same lack of ownership as public accounts. Anything posted on social media, whether it is on a private or public account, is likely open to ownership by the platform rather than the user.
