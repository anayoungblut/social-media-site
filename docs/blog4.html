            To be entirely transparent, my experience with disability and 
            my own social media is quite underdeveloped. One of my first 
            memories of a disabled creator is Molly Burke, a YouTuber who 
            shares her experience with blindness. Molly's content centers 
            around her disability as she often posts videos showing how she 
            does certain tasks as a blind individual or tries new things that 
            might be more difficult for someone with impaired vision. I 
            have not watched her videos in a few years, but I recall finding
            them educational and entertaining because of who Molly is as a 
            person--not because of her disability.
        </p>
        <p style='text-indent: 25px;' class='blog-post'>
            According to American Community Survey (ACS), Molly would be 
            considered disabled in the "communicative domain" because she 
            "Was blind or had difficulty seeing" (Kidd 108). As I understand 
            it, "disability" is a very subjective, interpretive word. There 
            is no straight-definition for disability and disabilities 
            themselves present in a multitude of ways. For instance, the 
            image of a woman standing from her wheelchair in a liquor store
             in Kidd's "Disabling a Meme" presents the epitome of disability 
             discourse; some individuals do not understand the complexity of 
             disability and the fact that individuals experience it differently.

            This is where my own social media comes into relation with disability.
             Under the ACS definition presented in Kidd, I would be considered 
             disabled because I am visually impaired and wear corrective lenses
              to have clearer vision. That said, I would like to preface that I
               do not personally  identify as disabled because of my vision. A 
               quick glance at my social media (Instagram in particular) would 
               not show that I am visually impaired. I guess I preferred how I 
               look without them despite wearing them 24/7 in reality. My 
               Instagram has started to show my glasses more in the past few 
               months, even going so far as to wear them in my profile picture. 
               This is my only personal projection of disability on social media.

            There are so many resources to learn how to be accessible and 
            platforms are growing to include more accessible options for users.
            Tik Tok in particular appears to be doing a good job of promoting 
            accessibility by auto-generating captions on user videos. Hashtags, 
            such as #Disability or #DisabledTikToker, often trend and promote 
            disabled users' accounts, thus normalizing disability for users who 
            might not be familiar disability.

            In regard to my other social media, I have lots of improvement to 
            make it more accessible. One of the easiest ways to make my social 
            media more accessible is with closed captioning: "They...enhance the 
            viewing experience for people watching in their non-native language, 
            or viewers in sound-off environments. Captions even benefit children 
            learning to read" (Sehl). I tend not to post videos on Instagram, 
            though will occasionally post a photo on my story that includes a song. Adding CC would make my post more accessible so users with hearing impairments can know which portion of the song is playing.

            Another way I can make my accounts more accessible would be to add 
            Alt Text, which is described as "comprehensively describing the image 
            for people using screen readers..." (Belmonte). I feel that Alt Text 
            is the easiest way to be accessible and, at the risk of being 
            hypocritical, the fact that more individuals do not take advantage of 
            it is baffling.
